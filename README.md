# Building a Scalable Clickstream Analytics Solution with AWS

This week, I created a **proof of concept** for a restaurant owner seeking insights into menu orders using AWS managed services. The solution aimed to handle real-time clickstream data ingestion, processing, and visualization while being cost-effective and scalable.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Ingestion**: Data collection using **Amazon API Gateway**.
2. **Transformation**: Data processed via **AWS Lambda**.
3. **Storage**: Processed data stored in **Amazon S3** with **Kinesis Data Firehose**.
4. **Querying**: Insights extracted using **Amazon Athena**.
5. **Visualization**: Dashboards created in **Amazon QuickSight**.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Data Collection with API Gateway
- Configured a REST API to capture clickstream data from the restaurantâ€™s website.
- POST requests routed to **Kinesis Firehose** for streaming.

### 2. Data Transformation with Lambda
- A Lambda function cleaned and formatted the incoming data.

### 3. Real-Time Processing with Kinesis Firehose
- Delivered processed data to an S3 bucket with inline transformations.

### 4. Data Storage in Amazon S3
- Centralized processed data in an S3 bucket with strict access controls.

### 5. Athena and QuickSight for Insights
- Queried S3-stored data using **Athena**.
- Built dashboards in **QuickSight** to identify trends like peak ordering times.

## Benefits of AWS Managed Services

- **Scalability**: Services like S3 and Lambda scale seamlessly.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go ensures affordability for small businesses.
- **User-Friendly**: QuickSight makes data insights accessible without heavy technical skills.

## Impact

- ðŸ’¡ The solution is entirely serverless, reducing operational overhead.
- ðŸ’¡ Interactive dashboards empower the owner to make data-driven decisions.
- ðŸ’¡ Modular design allows future upgrades, such as predictive analytics.

This project was a great way to showcase the potential of AWS for building real-time analytics pipelines.
